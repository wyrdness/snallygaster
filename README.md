## Overview

The Snallygaster is a dragon-like creature from Maryland folklore, particularly associated with Frederick County and the Blue Ridge Mountains. The name derives from German "schnelle geister" (quick spirit), reflecting its origins in German immigrant communities of the 1700s.

Described variably as half-bird, half-reptile with dragon-like or bat-like wings, a metal beak, sharp teeth, and in some accounts, tentacles, the creature was said to snatch livestock and children while terrorizing the countryside.

The Snallygaster gained widespread attention during the 1909 newspaper panic when sensational reports claimed sightings across Maryland, with newspapers even claiming Smithsonian interest. While largely considered newspaper sensationalism, the Snallygaster remains a beloved local legend, inspiring brewery names, tourist attractions, and regional folklore.
